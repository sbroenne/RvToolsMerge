# CI/CD Documentation for RVToolsMerge

This document outlines the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes used in the RVToolsMerge project.

## Workflow Overview

RVToolsMerge uses GitHub Actions for all CI/CD pipelines. The main workflows are:

1. **Build and Test** - Triggered on pull requests and pushes to main branch for code changes
2. **Version Management & Release** - Manual workflow for incrementing version numbers with automatic PR creation and optional release creation
3. **Code Coverage** - Generates code coverage reports and badges for the project
4. **Security Scanning** - Includes CodeQL analysis, dependency review, and vulnerability scanning
5. **Auto Labeling** - Automatically adds labels to pull requests based on file changes
6. **Workflow Cleanup** - Automatically cleans up old workflow runs to maintain repository hygiene
7. **Winget Submission** - Manual workflow for preparing and submitting packages to the Windows Package Manager repository

## Build Workflow

The Build workflow (`build.yml`) is a reusable workflow that handles building and testing the application on all supported platforms:

-   **Platforms**: Windows (x64, ARM64), Linux (x64), macOS (ARM64)
-   **Usage**: Called by other workflows to ensure consistent builds
-   **Features**:
    -   Caches NuGet packages for faster builds
    -   Builds the application in the specified configuration
    -   Runs all tests
    -   When building in Release mode, publishes platform-specific self-contained executables
    -   For Windows builds in Release mode, creates MSI installers using WiX Toolset 6.0.1
    -   Uploads both executable and MSI artifacts for release builds

## .NET CI Workflow

The .NET CI workflow (`dotnet.yml`) is triggered on code changes:

-   **Trigger**: Push or pull request that modifies .NET code files or project settings
-   **Platform**: Windows
-   **Function**:
    -   Builds the application in Debug configuration
    -   Runs all tests

## Azure Infrastructure Requirements

For self-hosted runners and Azure deployments:

-   **Operating System**: Windows 11 Pro (23H2) only
-   **Platform Support**: Standardized on Windows 11 Pro for consistency and optimal Azure Hybrid Use Benefit licensing
-   **Azure Hybrid Use Benefit**: Enabled by default for up to 40% cost savings with proper Windows Client licensing

## Code Coverage Workflow

The Code Coverage workflow (`code-coverage.yml`) generates detailed coverage reports and badges:

-   **Trigger**: Push to main branch that modifies .NET code files or manual workflow dispatch
-   **Platform**: Windows
-   **Function**:
    -   Builds the application in Release configuration
    -   Runs all tests with code coverage collection
    -   Generates HTML coverage reports and badges
    -   Publishes coverage badge to GitHub Pages
    -   Makes reports available as workflow artifacts

## Workflow Cleanup

The Workflow Cleanup workflow (`cleanup-workflow-runs.yml`) maintains repository hygiene by automatically removing old workflow runs:

-   **Trigger**:
    -   Scheduled daily at 2 AM UTC
    -   Manual workflow dispatch with optional parameters
-   **Platform**: Ubuntu
-   **Parameters** (manual dispatch only):
    -   `keep_runs`: Number of runs to keep for each workflow (default: 3)
    -   `retain_days`: Number of days to retain workflow runs (default: 30)
-   **Function**:
    -   Keeps only the latest runs of each workflow (configurable via manual trigger)
    -   Removes runs older than the specified retention period (configurable via manual trigger)
    -   Cleans up runs with all conclusion states (cancelled, failure, success, skipped)
    -   Provides summary of cleanup actions performed
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Reduces repository storage usage
    -   Improves workflow run browsing performance
    -   Maintains relevant run history while removing clutter
    -   Configurable retention settings for different cleanup scenarios

## Winget Submission Workflow

The Winget Submission workflow (`winget-submission.yml`) automates the preparation and submission of RVToolsMerge to the Windows Package Manager repository:

-   **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch only
-   **Inputs**:
    -   `releaseTag`: Specific release tag to process (e.g., "v1.3.4") or empty for latest release
    -   `dryRun`: Set to `true` for testing without creating branches (default: false)
-   **Platform**: Ubuntu
-   **Prerequisites**:
    -   Fork of `microsoft/winget-pkgs` repository at `https://github.com/sbroenne/winget-pkgs`
    -   Personal access token with `repo` scope stored as `WINGET_SUBMISSION_TOKEN` repository secret
    -   GitHub release with required winget manifest files
-   **Function**:
    -   Downloads winget manifests from the specified or latest GitHub release
    -   Validates manifest files and YAML syntax
    -   Creates submission branch in the forked winget-pkgs repository
    -   Prepares complete submission information and PR template
    -   Provides direct links for creating pull requests to Microsoft's repository
-   **Required Manifest Files**:
    -   `RvToolsMerge.RvToolsMerge.yaml` (version manifest)
    -   `RvToolsMerge.RvToolsMerge.installer.yaml` (installer manifest)
    -   `RvToolsMerge.RvToolsMerge.locale.en-US.yaml` (locale manifest)
-   **Artifacts Generated**:
    -   Validated winget manifests
    -   Submission information with package details
    -   Pull request template for winget community submission
    -   Release notes extracted from GitHub release

## Version Management & Release Workflow

The Version Management & Release workflow (`version-management.yml`) handles systematic version increments and optional release creation:

-   **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch only
-   **Inputs**:
    -   `versionType`: Type of version increment (major, minor, patch)
    -   `createRelease`: Whether to create a GitHub release after version bump (default: true)
-   **Function**:
    1. Extracts current version from the project file
    2. Validates version components are within .NET limits (0-65535)
    3. Increments version based on specified type
    4. Updates both package version and assembly version
    5. Creates a PR with version changes
    6. Automatically approves and attempts to merge the PR
    7. Creates a version tag if the merge is successful
    8. If `createRelease` is true:
        - Builds release artifacts for all platforms
        - Creates platform-specific archives
        - Creates a GitHub Release with the archives attached

### Version Management & Release Process

The automated version management and release process follows these steps:

1. Extract the current version number from the project file
2. Validate that all version components are valid integers within the .NET range (0-65535)
3. Increment the appropriate component based on the selected increment type
4. Update version elements in the project file:
    - `<Version>` (NuGet package version)
    - `<AssemblyVersion>` (Assembly metadata version)
    - `<FileVersion>` (File version for Windows)
5. Create a new branch for the version change
6. Commit the changes and push to the repository
7. Create a pull request with conventional commit format: "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
8. Auto-approve the PR to satisfy branch protection requirements
9. Attempt to auto-merge the PR with retry logic
10. Create and push a version tag (vX.Y.Z) once the PR is merged
11. If release creation is enabled:
    - Build release artifacts for all supported platforms (Windows x64/ARM64, Linux x64, macOS ARM64)
    - Create MSI installers for Windows platforms using WiX Toolset 6.0.1
    - Generate winget manifests with calculated MSI SHA256 hashes
    - Create platform-specific ZIP archives
    - Create GitHub Release with release notes, download links, and winget manifests

## Release Process Guide

To create a new release:

1. Use the Version Management & Release workflow to increment the version
2. Choose whether to create a release immediately by setting `createRelease` to true
3. The workflow will automatically build and publish the release if enabled

To submit to Windows Package Manager (winget):

1. Ensure a GitHub release exists with winget manifest files
2. Use the Winget Submission workflow with the desired release tag
3. Test with `dryRun: true` first to validate the submission
4. Run without dry run to create the submission branch
5. Use the provided PR creation link to submit to Microsoft's winget-pkgs repository

## Code Coverage in Releases

Code coverage is now handled exclusively by the dedicated code-coverage.yml workflow to optimize workflow performance while maintaining comprehensive test coverage reporting.

## MSI Installer and WiX Integration

The project includes automated MSI installer generation for Windows platforms using WiX Toolset 6.0.1:

### MSI Build Process

1. **Automatic Trigger**: MSI installers are built during Release configuration builds on Windows runners
2. **WiX Installation**: The build workflow automatically installs WiX Toolset 6.0.1 and required extensions
3. **Version Extraction**: MSI version is automatically extracted from the compiled executable
4. **Multi-Architecture**: Creates MSI files for both x64 and ARM64 Windows architectures
5. **File Naming**: MSI files follow the pattern `RVToolsMerge-{version}-{runtime}.msi`

### Winget Integration

The release process includes automated Windows Package Manager (winget) manifest generation:

1. **Template Processing**: Uses templates in `.github/winget-templates/` to generate manifests
2. **SHA256 Calculation**: Automatically calculates and includes MSI file hashes
3. **Version Synchronization**: Ensures winget package version matches release version
4. **Artifact Upload**: Generated manifests are included in GitHub releases
5. **Community Distribution**: Manifests can be submitted to Microsoft's winget-pkgs repository

### Manual MSI Build

For local development and testing, MSI installers can be built manually:

```powershell
# Install WiX Toolset
dotnet tool install --global wix --version 6.0.1

# Publish application
dotnet publish src/RVToolsMerge/RVToolsMerge.csproj --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained true --output publish

# Build MSI
cd installer
wix build RVToolsMerge.wxs -define PublishDir="../publish" -out "RVToolsMerge-win-x64.msi" -ext WixToolset.UI.wixext
```

## CI/CD Security Considerations

-   GitHub Actions permissions are carefully scoped for each workflow
-   Secrets are managed through GitHub Secrets
-   Build artifacts are created in a clean, isolated environment
-   All dependencies are explicitly pinned to specific versions

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

-   **Version workflow fails**:
    -   Ensure csproj file exists and has proper version elements (`<Version>`, `<AssemblyVersion>`, `<FileVersion>`)
    -   Check that the version format is valid (X.Y.Z format)
    -   Verify that version components don't exceed .NET assembly version limits (0-65535)
    -   Check workflow logs for detailed error messages with validation steps
-   **Release creation fails**:
    -   Verify build artifacts are properly generated and version format is correct
    -   Ensure MSI creation succeeded on Windows runners using WiX Toolset
    -   Check winget manifest generation completed successfully
    -   Verify that all expected platforms completed their builds
    -   Ensure MSI SHA256 hashes were calculated correctly for winget manifests
-   **Publication error**:
    -   Check for valid GitHub permissions and tokens
    -   Verify that the repository allows Actions to create PRs and releases
    -   Ensure no existing PR conflicts with the version update branch
-   **Code coverage not found**: Ensure Windows x64 build completes successfully and generates coverage files
-   **Workflow cleanup fails**:
    -   Verify the GITHUB_TOKEN has sufficient permissions for Actions scope
    -   Check if any workflow runs are currently in progress (they cannot be deleted)
    -   Ensure the cleanup action has proper access to repository Actions
    -   Review retention settings if unexpected runs are being deleted
    -   Verify that custom retention day values are valid positive integers
-   **Winget submission fails**:
    -   Ensure the fork repository exists and is accessible (`https://github.com/sbroenne/winget-pkgs`)
    -   Verify the personal access token (`WINGET_SUBMISSION_TOKEN`) has correct permissions
    -   Check that all required manifest files are present in the GitHub release
    -   Validate manifest files have correct YAML syntax
    -   Ensure the release tag format is correct (e.g., "v1.3.4")
    -   Test with dry run first to identify issues before actual submission
-   **Branch creation fails**:
    -   Check for existing version update branches that may conflict
    -   Verify git configuration and push permissions
    -   Ensure the version increment didn't create duplicate branch names
-   **PR auto-merge fails**:
    -   Verify repository branch protection rules allow auto-merge
    -   Check that required status checks are configured correctly
    -   Ensure the GitHub token has sufficient permissions

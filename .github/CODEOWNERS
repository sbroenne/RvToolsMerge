# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, they will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies certain file types,
# only the owners of those file types will be requested for a review.

# Examples:
# *.cs    @dotnet-codeowners
# *.yml   @devops-team
# /docs/  @documentation-team

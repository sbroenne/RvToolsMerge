A modern, cross-platform console application for merging one or multiple [RVTools](https://www.robware.net/rvtools/) export files into a single consolidated file. Supports anonymization of sensitive data.

> Created by Stefan Broenner (github.com/sbroenne) and contributors

## Overview

RVToolsMerge is a powerful command-line utility designed to consolidate multiple RVTools exports into one Excel file, making it easier to analyze VMware environment data from different sources.

Built with .NET 9, this cross-platform tool efficiently processes individual RVTools Excel files or entire directories, intelligently merging data from key sheets while ensuring consistency across the consolidated output.

As an independent, open-source project, RVToolsMerge is *not affiliated with* the official RVTools application but works with its export data to provide additional functionality.

## Data Protection & Security

RVToolsMerge treats security and data protection as top priorities, especially when handling sensitive VMware infrastructure data:

### Key Data Protection Features

- **Complete Anonymization**: Automatically replace sensitive identifiers with generic equivalents:
  - VM names → vm1, vm2, vm3...
  - DNS names → dns1, dns2, dns3...
  - IP addresses → ip1, ip2, ip3...
  - Cluster names → cluster1, cluster2...
  - Host names → host1, host2...
  - Datacenter names → datacenter1, datacenter2...

- **Minimal Data Exposure**: The `--only-mandatory-columns` option limits data to essential fields only, preventing unnecessary exposure of sensitive information

- **Consistent Anonymization**: Maintains relationships between data points even after anonymization (same VM names are consistently replaced with the same anonymized values across all sheets)

- **Source Tracking Control**: Optional inclusion of source file information gives you control over data lineage visibility

These protection features make RVToolsMerge ideal for:
- Creating sanitized reports for vendors and consultants
- Sharing infrastructure data while maintaining confidentiality
- Generating documentation that doesn't expose sensitive internal naming
- Ensuring compliance with organization data-sharing policies

## Features

- **High-Performance Processing**: Built with .NET 9 and optimized for speed and memory efficiency
- **Rich Console Experience**: Beautiful console output with progress bars, status indicators, and colorful tables
- **Intelligent Sheet Handling**: Combines multiple RVTools exports while validating required sheets and columns
- **Flexible Processing Options**:
  - Processes single files or entire directories of RVTools exports
  - Includes only columns that appear in all source files
  - Optionally ignores missing optional sheets
  - Selectively includes only mandatory columns
  - Adds source file tracking for data lineage
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS with native binaries for each platform
- **Enterprise-Grade Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear, actionable error messages

## Supported Sheets and Required Columns

RVToolsMerge processes the following key sheets from RVTools exports:

### Required and Optional Sheets

| Sheet Name | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **vInfo** | **Required** | Core VM information (CPU, memory, OS) |
| **vHost** | Optional | ESXi host configuration and performance data |
| **vPartition** | Optional | VM disk partition information |
| **vMemory** | Optional | VM memory configuration details |

The `vInfo` sheet must be present in all processed files. The other sheets are considered optional and can be handled according to your configuration.

### Mandatory Columns by Sheet

Each sheet has specific required columns that must be present for proper processing:

#### vInfo Sheet (Required)
- Template
- SRM Placeholder  
- Powerstate
- VM
- CPUs
- Memory
- In Use MiB
- OS according to the configuration file

#### vHost Sheet (Optional)
- Host
- Datacenter
- Cluster
- CPU Model
- Speed
- \# CPU
- Cores per CPU
- \# Cores
- CPU usage %
- \# Memory
- Memory usage %

#### vPartition Sheet (Optional)
- VM
- Disk
- Capacity MiB
- Consumed MiB

#### vMemory Sheet (Optional)
- VM
- Size MiB
- Reservation

## Column Name Mappings

The application standardizes column names across different RVTools exports. This helps handle variations in column naming between different versions of RVTools.

For a complete reference of all column mappings, see [Column Mappings Documentation](docs/ColumnMappings.md).

```

## Anonymization and Data Protection

RVToolsMerge offers robust data protection features for handling sensitive infrastructure information:

### Anonymization (-a, --anonymize)

When using the anonymization option, the following data is consistently anonymized:

- VM names → vm1, vm2, vm3, etc.
- DNS names → dns1, dns2, dns3, etc.
- IP addresses → ip1, ip2, ip3, etc.
- Cluster names → cluster1, cluster2, cluster3, etc.
- Host names → host1, host2, host3, etc.
- Datacenter names → datacenter1, datacenter2, datacenter3, etc.

Anonymization maintains internal data relationships, ensuring that the same original value always maps to the same anonymized value throughout all sheets, preserving data integrity while protecting sensitive information.

### Mandatory Columns Only Mode (-M, --only-mandatory-columns)

The mandatory columns only mode provides an additional layer of data protection by:

- Including only essential columns required for analysis
- Excluding potentially sensitive columns that might contain organization-specific information
- Reducing the data footprint in the output file
- Limiting exposure of non-essential infrastructure details

This option is particularly useful when:
- Sharing reports with external parties
- Creating documentation for public consumption
- Generating simplified reports focused on specific metrics
- Ensuring compliance with data sharing policies

### Combined Data Protection

For maximum data protection, combine multiple options:

```
RVToolsMerge -a -M -s /path/to/inputs /path/to/output.xlsx
```

This produces a streamlined report with only essential columns containing fully anonymized data while preserving all analytical value and relationships between data points. The `-s` option adds source tracking for better data lineage.

## Validation Behavior and Error Handling

RVToolsMerge implements robust validation to ensure data integrity:

### Validation Rules

- **By default**: All required sheets with all mandatory columns must exist in all files
- **With `-m` (ignore-missing-sheets)**: 
  - The vInfo sheet remains required in all files
  - Optional sheets (vHost, vPartition, vMemory) can be missing
  - Missing mandatory columns in optional sheets will cause errors unless handled by other options
- **With `-i` (skip-invalid-files)**:
  - Files without the required vInfo sheet will be skipped
  - Files with vInfo sheet but missing mandatory vInfo columns will be skipped
  - Files with optional sheets having missing mandatory columns will be skipped
- **With `-e` (skip-empty-values)**:
  - Rows with empty values in mandatory columns will be skipped from the output
  - Without this option, rows with empty mandatory values are included (default behavior)
  - Useful when you want to only include complete data records
- **With both `-i` and `-m` together**:
  - Files without vInfo sheet will be skipped
  - Files with vInfo sheet but missing mandatory vInfo columns will be skipped
  - Files with complete vInfo sheet but missing optional sheets will be processed
  - Files with optional sheets missing mandatory columns will be processed, but those sheets may be excluded

## Sample Files

The project includes sample files in the `input` directory:

- `default.xlsx`: Standard RVTools export format with all required sheets and columns
- `altenativeColumnNames.xlsx`: Example file with alternative column naming variations

These files can be used to test the application and understand the expected format of RVTools exports.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using RVToolsMerge:

| Issue | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------------------|
| General errors | Enable debug mode with `-d` to see detailed error information |
| Missing sheets errors | Use `-m` to ignore missing optional sheets |
| Files causing validation errors | Use `-i` to skip invalid files and continue processing others |
| Row count mismatches | By default, rows with empty mandatory values are included; use `-e` to skip them |
| Low memory issues | Process smaller batches of files |
| Permission errors | Ensure you have write access to the output folder |
| Excel file locked | Close any applications that might have the file open |
| Slow performance | Check for antivirus scanning; consider excluding the working folders |

## Technical Architecture

RVToolsMerge is built with .NET 9 and follows modern C# development practices:

### Key Components

- **ClosedXML**: High-performance Excel file handling
- **Spectre.Console**: Rich console UI with progress bars, tables, and colors
- **Modern C# Features**: Using the latest C# features like records, pattern matching, and nullable reference types


## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later

### Basic Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbroenne/RVToolsMerge.git
cd RVToolsMerge
dotnet build -c Release
```

### Creating Deployable Packages

By default, `dotnet build` creates a framework-dependent build. For self-contained applications that don't require .NET runtime:

```bash
# For Windows x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

# For Windows ARM64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-arm64

# For Linux x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64

# For macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64
```

Output will be in `bin/Release/net9.0/{RID}/publish` directory, where `{RID}` is the runtime identifier.

### Development Workflow

When running from source with parameters, use a double-dash (`--`) to separate the `dotnet run` command from the application parameters:

```bash
# Basic syntax
dotnet run -- [options] [inputPath] [outputFile]

# Example
dotnet run -- -m -i C:\RVTools\Exports C:\Output\Merged.xlsx
```

A modern, cross-platform console application for merging one or multiple [RVTools](https://www.robware.net/rvtools/) export files into a single consolidated file. Supports anonymization of sensitive data.

> Created by Stefan Broenner (github.com/sbroenne) and contributors

## What is RVTools?

[RVTools](https://www.robware.net/rvtools/) is a popular Windows application for exporting detailed inventory and configuration data from VMware vSphere environments to Excel files. It is widely used by VMware administrators for reporting and analysis.

## Overview

RVToolsMerge is a powerful command-line utility designed to consolidate multiple RVTools exports into one Excel file, making it easier to analyze VMware environment data from different sources.

Built with .NET 9, this cross-platform tool efficiently processes individual RVTools Excel files or entire directories, intelligently merging data from key sheets while ensuring consistency across the consolidated output.

As an independent, open-source project, RVToolsMerge is _not affiliated with_ the official RVTools application but works with its export data to provide additional functionality.

## Data Protection & Security

RVToolsMerge treats security and data protection as top priorities, especially when handling sensitive VMware infrastructure data:

### Key Data Protection Features

-   **Complete Anonymization**: Automatically replace sensitive identifiers with generic equivalents (per file):

    -   VM names → vm123_1, vm456_2, vm789_3... (unique per file)
    -   DNS names → dns123_1, dns456_2, dns789_3... (unique per file)
    -   IP addresses → ip123_1, ip456_2, ip789_3... (unique per file)
    -   Cluster names → cluster123_1, cluster456_2... (unique per file)
    -   Host names → host123_1, host456_2... (unique per file)
    -   Datacenter names → datacenter123_1, datacenter456_2... (unique per file)

-   **Minimal Data Exposure**: The `--only-mandatory-columns` option limits data to essential fields only, preventing unnecessary exposure of sensitive information

-   **Consistent Anonymization**: Maintains relationships between data points with per-file anonymization (same original values within a file are consistently replaced with the same anonymized values, while the same values in different files get different anonymized values)

-   **Source Tracking Control**: Optional inclusion of source file information gives you control over data lineage visibility

These protection features make RVToolsMerge ideal for:

-   Creating sanitized reports for vendors and consultants
-   Sharing infrastructure data while maintaining confidentiality
-   Generating documentation that doesn't expose sensitive internal naming
-   Ensuring compliance with organization data-sharing policies

## Features

-   **High-Performance Processing**: Built with .NET 9 and optimized for speed and memory efficiency
-   **Rich Console Experience**: Beautiful console output with progress bars, status indicators, and colorful tables
-   **Intelligent Sheet Handling**: Combines multiple RVTools exports while validating required sheets and columns
-   **Flexible Processing Options**:
    -   Processes single files or entire directories of RVTools exports
    -   Includes only columns that appear in all source files
    -   Optionally ignores missing optional sheets
    -   Selectively includes only mandatory columns
    -   Adds source file tracking for data lineage
-   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS with native binaries for each platform
-   **Enterprise-Grade Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear, actionable error messages

## Supported Sheets and Required Columns

RVToolsMerge processes key sheets from RVTools exports with specific validation requirements for each sheet type.

For detailed information about supported sheets and their required columns, see [Supported Sheets Documentation](docs/SupportedSheets.md).

## Column Name Mappings

The application standardizes column names across different RVTools exports. This helps handle variations in column naming between different versions of RVTools.

For a complete reference of all column mappings, see [Column Mappings Documentation](docs/ColumnMappings.md).

```

## Anonymization and Data Protection

RVToolsMerge offers robust data protection features for handling sensitive infrastructure information:

### Anonymization (-a, --anonymize)

When using the anonymization option, the following data is consistently anonymized (per file):

-   VM names → vm123_1, vm456_2, vm789_3, etc. (unique per file)
-   DNS names → dns123_1, dns456_2, dns789_3, etc. (unique per file)
-   IP addresses → ip123_1, ip456_2, ip789_3, etc. (unique per file)
-   Cluster names → cluster123_1, cluster456_2, cluster789_3, etc. (unique per file)
-   Host names → host123_1, host456_2, host789_3, etc. (unique per file)
-   Datacenter names → datacenter123_1, datacenter456_2, datacenter789_3, etc. (unique per file)

Anonymization maintains internal data relationships within each file, ensuring that the same original value in a file always maps to the same anonymized value throughout all sheets in that file. Values that appear in different source files will be anonymized to different values, ensuring there's never any overlap between anonymized values from different files.

When anonymization is enabled, an additional Excel file is created alongside the output file with the naming pattern `<output_filename>_AnonymizationMap.xlsx`. This file contains the mapping between original values and their anonymized equivalents for each source file, which can be used later to de-anonymize the data if needed.

After processing is complete, a summary of anonymization statistics per file is displayed, showing how many items of each type were anonymized from each source file.

For more details on how anonymization is implemented, see the [Column Mappings Documentation](docs/ColumnMappings.md).

### Mandatory Columns Only Mode (-M, --only-mandatory-columns)

The mandatory columns only mode provides an additional layer of data protection by:

-   Including only essential columns required for analysis
-   Excluding potentially sensitive columns that might contain organization-specific information
-   Reducing the data footprint in the output file
-   Limiting exposure of non-essential infrastructure details

This option is particularly useful when:

-   Sharing reports with external parties
-   Creating documentation for public consumption
-   Generating simplified reports focused on specific metrics
-   Ensuring compliance with data sharing policies

### Combined Data Protection

For maximum data protection, combine multiple options:

```
RVToolsMerge -a -M -s /path/to/inputs /path/to/output.xlsx
```

This produces a streamlined report with only essential columns containing fully anonymized data while preserving all analytical value and relationships between data points. The `-s` option adds source tracking for better data lineage.

## Azure Migrate Validation (-z, --azure-migrate)

RVToolsMerge provides validation support for Azure Migrate requirements to ensure your VMware inventory data can be successfully imported into Azure Migrate.

### Azure Migrate Validation Features

When using the Azure Migrate validation option, RVToolsMerge:

-   Validates that VM UUIDs are present and not null for all VMs
-   Validates that OS configuration data is present and not null
-   Ensures VM UUIDs are unique across all entries (no duplicates)
-   Enforces the Azure Migrate limit of 20,000 VMs
-   Tracks rows that were skipped due to the VM count limit

### Validation Results and Reporting

-   Rows that fail validation are exported to a separate Excel file with the naming pattern `<output_filename>_FailedAzureMigrateValidation.xlsx`
-   The console displays detailed validation statistics including:
    -   Count of rows with missing VM UUIDs
    -   Count of rows with missing OS configurations
    -   Count of rows with duplicate VM UUIDs
    -   Count of rows excluded due to VM limit
    -   Count of rows not processed (skipped) after reaching the 20,000 VM limit
    -   Total count of failed validations

### Usage Example

```
RVToolsMerge -z /path/to/inputs /path/to/output.xlsx
```

This option is especially useful when:

-   Preparing VMware inventory data for Azure migration assessments
-   Pre-validating RVTools exports before uploading to Azure Migrate
-   Identifying problematic VM records that would fail Azure Migrate import
-   Ensuring your migration assessment includes all critical VMs

For maximum preparation before uploading to Azure Migrate, consider combining with other options:

```
RVToolsMerge -z -s -e /path/to/inputs /path/to/azure_migrate_ready.xlsx
```

This validates for Azure Migrate requirements, includes source file tracking, and skips rows with empty mandatory values.

## Validation Behavior and Error Handling

RVToolsMerge implements robust validation to ensure data integrity:

### Validation Rules

-   **By default (all options disabled)**: All required sheets with all mandatory columns must exist in all files. Files that don't meet these requirements will cause the operation to fail.
-   **With `-m` (ignore-missing-sheets)**:
    -   The vInfo sheet remains required in all files
    -   Optional sheets (vHost, vPartition, vMemory) can be missing without causing failures
    -   Missing mandatory columns in optional sheets will still cause errors unless handled by other options
-   **With `-i` (skip-invalid-files)**:
    -   Files without the required vInfo sheet will be skipped and processing will continue
    -   Files with vInfo sheet but missing mandatory vInfo columns will be skipped
    -   Files with optional sheets having missing mandatory columns will be skipped
-   **With `-e` (skip-empty-values)**:
    -   Rows with empty values in mandatory columns will be excluded from the output
    -   By default (when this option is disabled), rows with empty mandatory values are included in the output
    -   Enable this option when you want to include only complete data records
-   **With both `-i` and `-m` together**:
    -   Files without vInfo sheet will be skipped
    -   Files with vInfo sheet but missing mandatory vInfo columns will be skipped
    -   Files with complete vInfo sheet but missing optional sheets will be processed
    -   Files with optional sheets missing mandatory columns will be processed, but those sheets may be excluded

### Default Behavior

**Important**: All processing options are disabled by default. This means:

-   **Strict validation**: Processing will fail if any file is missing required sheets or columns
-   **No anonymization**: All original data values are preserved in the output
-   **All columns included**: Both mandatory and optional columns are included when available
-   **No source tracking**: The source file name is not added to the merged data
-   **Empty values preserved**: Rows with empty mandatory values are included in the output
-   **Full error reporting**: Only basic error messages are shown (use `-d` for detailed debugging)

To enable any special processing behavior, you must explicitly specify the corresponding command-line options.

## Sample Files

The project includes sample files in the `input` directory:

-   `default.xlsx`: Standard RVTools export format with all required sheets and columns
-   `altenativeColumnNames.xlsx`: Example file with alternative column naming variations

These files can be used to test the application and understand the expected format of RVTools exports.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using RVToolsMerge:

| Files causing validation errors | Use `-i` to skip invalid files and continue processing others (disabled by default)       |
| Row count mismatches            | By default, rows with empty mandatory values are included; use `-e` to exclude them       |
| Need data protection            | Use `-a` for anonymization and `-M` for mandatory columns only (both disabled by default) |
| Preparing for Azure migration   | Use `-z` to validate against Azure Migrate requirements (disabled by default)             |
| Want to track data origin       | Use `-s` to include source file information (disabled by default)                         |
| Low memory issues               | Process smaller batches of files                                                          |
| Permission errors               | Ensure you have write access to the output folder                                         |
| Excel file locked               | Close any applications that might have the file open                                      |

## Technical Architecture

RVToolsMerge is built with .NET 9 and follows modern C# development practices:

### Key Components

-   **ClosedXML**: High-performance Excel file handling
-   **Spectre.Console**: Rich console UI with progress bars, tables, and colors
-   **Modern C# Features**: Using the latest C# features like records, pattern matching, and nullable reference types

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

-   .NET 9.0 SDK or later

### Basic Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbroenne/RVToolsMerge.git
cd RVToolsMerge
dotnet build -c Release
```

### Creating Deployable Packages

By default, `dotnet build` creates a framework-dependent build. For self-contained applications that don't require .NET runtime:

```bash
# For Windows x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

# For Windows ARM64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-arm64

# For Linux x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64

# For macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64
```

Output will be in `bin/Release/net9.0/{RID}/publish` directory, where `{RID}` is the runtime identifier.

### Development Workflow

When running from source with parameters, use a double-dash (`--`) to separate the `dotnet run` command from the application parameters:

```bash
# Basic syntax
dotnet run -- [options] [inputPath] [outputFile]

# Example
dotnet run -- -m -i C:\RVTools\Exports C:\Output\Merged.xlsx
```
